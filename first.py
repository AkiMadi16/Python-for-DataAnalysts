# let's see how to print data in the console
# we use print function 
# we need to write a word inside quotes which called a string
# we don't need the quotes when we declare a number i.e integer 


print("Hello")
print(24)

# let's see how we declare variables 
#  check the type of a variable

# Example
name = "Alice"  # String
age = 28        # Integer
height = 5.7    # Float
is_analyst = True  # Boolean

#let's see how these variables print in the console

print(name)
print(type(name)) 
# Output: <class 'str'>
print(type(is_analyst))
# Output: <class 'bool'>
